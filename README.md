Force Resistive Sensor Design

This project includes the design, manufacturing, and 3D simulation of a soft force resistive sensor. 3D design and mold models are saved in 3D design folder. Molds are 3D printed and Ecoflex 00-30 is used for the base material of the sensor. Conductive carbon ink is injected into the channels which works as the resistive and conductive element of the sensor.
